,ALASKA (AK) CURRENT SUMMARY,Eviction Cases can Resume (Remote or In-Person),"On March 20, the Governor issued an executive order that suspends evictions for tenants who recieve rental assistance through the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation. On April 10, the legislature passed a bill that suspends any statute that would give a cause of action for evictions or foreclosures, but only as applied to tenants or mortgagees experiencing financial hardship due to COVID-19. The legislation also suspended utility disconnection due to COVID-19 hardship and provided homeless prevention funding. On April 3, the State Supreme Court placed a moratorium on all non-emergency cases.  On April 24, the Court began holding remote eviction hearings in cases not covered under the legislature's prohibition or the CARES Act moratorium.  On June 1, the Supreme Court's moratorium on in-person proceedings ended and the legislature's prohibition on evictions resulting from COVID-19 financial hardship has expired. Some localities have suspended utility and water shutoffs.

,ARIZONA (AZ) CURRENT SUMMARY,COVID-19 Eviction Enforcement Suspended,"The Governor has issued a stay on executing all evictions statewide for tenants who can show (1) that they have suffered a substantial loss of income due to COVID-19, (2) that they or a family member have been ordered to stay in quarantine by a medical professional, or (3) that they have a health condition that makes them more at risk to COVID-19. Evictions proceedings are managed by each Superior Court at the local level. So while evictions actions can't be executed, they can still be filed and managed in court.  Statutory deadlines for courts to hold eviction proceedings are tolled from 3/18-9/30, and that time will not be counted in computing the deadline once the tolling period ends.

,CALIFORNIA (CA) CURRENT SUMMARY,Eviction Cases & Enforcement Suspended,"The Judicial Council of California adopted emergency rules preventing the issuance of summons and the entry of default in all foreclosure and eviction cases, including commercial, unless there is a threat to public health. The rules also postpone trials for at least 60 days. The Governor has issued an executive order banning the enforcement of eviction orders, and tolling response time for new eviction complaints, for renters affected by COVID-19 through May 31, 2020. This order still allows for local governments to pass their own stricter eviction bans. The Governor issued an order giving local governments authority to halt evictions, slow foreclosures, and protect against utility shutoffs until September 30, 2020. Since then several local governments have adopted coronavirus-specific eviction restrictions. Most of these require tenants to provide documentation to verify that they are unable to pay rent due to financial impacts related to COVID-19.

,COLORADO (CO) CURRENT SUMMARY,Eviction Cases can Resume (Remote or In-Person),"Gov. Polis's current executive order requires that landlords must provide tenants with thirty (30) days’ notice of any default for non-payment before initiating or filing action for forcible entry and detainer. The order also prohibits late fees in all cases and requests that landlords implement the model repayment plan created by the Dept. of Local Affairs. The state has established a low-income rental assistance program for households impacted by COVID-19, and has devoted funding to direct housing assistance and legal representation. Nearly all judicial districts and several counties have issued orders continuing most civil matters or ordering them to be done via teleconference. Finally, several utilities providers in Colorado have suspended shutoffs; several towns and cities have asked providers to do the same or else said that they will not disconnect service.",Court/Governor,,,Local Discretion,,,,6/13/20,6/13/20,N,N,Local Discretion,Y,Y,Y,N,N,N/A,Y,Non-payment related to COVID-19,N,N/A,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,Y,N,,,,,,,,Y,,,,,,,Y,
,COLORADO (CO) PEAK STATUS SUMMARY,,"Previously, Colorado's Governor had issued an executive order that prohibits enforcement of evictions and filing of eviction cases in cases where non-payment of rent was due to financial hardship created by COVID-19. The governor had also directed that some foreclosure sale deadlines are extended to April 30, and treasurers are authorized to waive delinquent interest on delinquent property tax payments. Colorado's Chief Justice issued an order suspending non-essential court functions; the order gives lower court judges discretion to determine whether matters not specifically mentioned in the order (which evictions are not) should be heard.

,CONNECTICUT (CT) CURRENT SUMMARY,Eviction Cases & Enforcement Suspended,"Per the Governor's order, eviction notices may not be issued to any tenant until August 22nd. Upon request, tenants that are able to show they were economically impacted by COVID-19 can have their landlord apply their security deposit to April, May, June, July, or August's rent. Tenants have a 60-day grace period to pay April rent, and may request an additional 60-day grace period for May rent if they are facing financial hardship due to COVID-19. The Chief Administrative Judge for Civil Matters has announced that execution of evictions is stayed through September 1, and foreclosure sales scheduled for March-May will take place in July. Further, during the time period when only Priority One cases are being heard by the court, all civil trials are suspended. The Governor has also suspended all statutory deadlines relating to the issuance of civil judgments. There is a 30-day utility shutoff moratorium in place as of March 13 and subject to renewal.

,DELAWARE (DE) CURRENT SUMMARY,Eviction Cases can Resume (Remote or In-Person),"On March 24th, Governor John Carney issued a comprehensive executive order establishing moratoriums for evictions, foreclosures, and utility shutoffs during the duration of the Covid-19 crisis. The order prevented new filings, tolled deadlines in pending cases until 31 days after the emergency ends, prevented execution of issued judgments, and prohibited landlords from charging late fees. It also prevented new foreclosure actions, tolls deadlines in ongoing foreclosure cases, and prevented sheriff sales and the execution of writs of possession until 31 days after the emergency ends. The Justice of the Peace Court has also ordered that all landlord/tenant cases and ordered/scheduled evictions between March 17 and April 16 be delayed until after May 1, with exceptions for ""landlord-tenant matters involving essential services and/or harm to persons or property."" On June 30, Governor John Carney issued an executive order peeling away the protections against evictions from his earlier orders. This order allows for the filings of new evictions. These actions, as well as previously filed actions, shall be stayed to determine if ADR or mediation would be appropriate. Tenants shall not be evicted during the declared emergency unless the court deems it necessary in the interest of justice. Tenants shall not be charged late fees from the state of emergency. Foreclosures may also be filed, and any deadlines that had been stayed are now lifted unless the court orders otherwise. Residents shall not be ejected during the emergency unless a judgment was entered in the foreclosure case prior to the start of the COVID-19 emergency. Actions filed should include supporting documents, as directed by the court and supplied by the landlord, that demonstrate that the subject property is not covered by the CARES Act. All utilities in Delaware should provide 4-month payment plans to households affected by COVID-19 that can demonstrate they suffered some impact by the least amount of proof necessary.",Court/Governor,,,Y,,,,post-emergency,,N,Y,Local Discretion,Y,Y,Y,N,N,N,N,N/A,Y,Deadlines in ongoing eviction and foreclosure proceedings are tolled to no sooner than 31st day after state of emergency ends,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,

The order also stated that ""a person or entity may not commence a residential eviction action."" This order has been extended through 8/22. The State Supreme Court has directed lower courts to keep fulfilling essential functions, but to delay or schedule remote hearings for non-essential matters. Local courts may also suspend deadlines. The State Supreme Court has ruled that plaintiffs in all residential actions must file an affidavit certifying that the property at issue is not covered under the CARES Act. The state has funded a rental and mortgage assistance program for residents struggling to make payments as a result of COVID-19. Additional funding has also been provided to the state's low income energy assistance program (LIHEAP). A moratorium on utility disconnections is in place until 8/1.

,INDIANA (IN) CURRENT SUMMARY,Nonpayment Eviction Cases Suspended,"In May, the Governor issued an executive order lifting the prohibition against emergency eviction and foreclosure actions as of May 22, and all evictions as of July 1. The Supreme Court of Indiana issued clarifying guidance in March that filings are still being accepted, and urging courts to consider public health, safety, and property values when using their discretion to decide whether to stay non-emergency proceedings. On 7/13, households can begin applying for the state's rental assistance program, which provides up to $500 payments for four months. Indiana has also placed a statewide moratorium on utility shut-offs and individual companies have announced that they will further suspend shutoffs. On 6/31, the Governor issued an executive order that extended the moratorium of evictions and foreclosures for non-payment until July 31. Notwithstanding the moratorium, a landlord may institute an emergency eviction or possessory claim where there is specific immediate and serious injury, or loss or damage to the property. Moreover, a lending institution is no longer prohibited from instituting a foreclosure action where the property is vacant or abandoned, or where there is a specific immediate and serious injury, or there is loss or damage to the property.",Court/Governor,,,Y,,,,7/31/2020,,N,N,Local Discretion,Y,Y,Y,N,Y,N,N,N/A,Y,Local discretion up to 8/14/20,N,In Effect Y,In Effect Y,Local Discretion,N,N,N,N,Y,Y,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,07/01/20,Y,

In addition, landlords and mortgagors are prohibited from issuing late fees and reporting to credit agencies where a nonpayment is due to COVID-19 financial hardship.

The moratorium ended on 7/16. Now the Eviction Diversion Program launches, awarding payments to landlords who agree not to evict tenants for housing debt accrued during COVID-19. Landlords must agree to waive late fees, and forgive up to 10% of the amount due. Households up to 100% of the state's median income are eligible for the program. Michigan's courts may still hear existing civil cases remotely or in-person if they have complied with the phased reopening plan created by the State Court Administrative Office. Court deadlines and deadlines to commence civil actions are tolled until 7/31. Property owners must submit verification that the property is exempt from the federal CARES Act moratorium.

,"NEW JERSEY (NJ) CURRENT
SUMMARY",Eviction Cases & Enforcement Suspended,"Governor Phil Murphy signed an Executive Order on 3/19 that halts the removal of residents pursuant to evictions or foreclosure proceedings for two months after the end of the emergency. On 7/2 Governor Murphy signed an Executive Order extending the statewide Public Health Emergency with no expiration date.Therefore the state's Eviction Moratorium is, in effect, extended with no expiration date. On 6/25, the State Supreme Court confirmed that the suspention of residential lockouts remains in effect, although landlord/tenant complaints can still be filed with the courts, and settlement conferences can be held. The state has enacted a temporary rental assistance program for low-income households impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Utilities companies have agreed to halt disconnections for the length of the crisis, and the Governor passed legislation empowering local authorities to waive interest and lien enforcement for delinquent water and sewer utility payments and suspend utility disconnections during public health emergencies.

,NEW YORK (NY) CURRENT SUMMARY,COVID-19 Hardship Eviction Cases Suspended,"On 6/30, the Governor signed the Tenant Safe Harbor Act, which suspends evictions for tenants who can show they have suffered financial hardship during the COVID-19 emergency period (includes rental debt accrued during the eviction moratorium) until all COVID-19 restrictions on gatherings and non-essential businesses are lifted. The Governor's Executive Order prohibits initiation of and enforcement of eviction for non-payment if a tenant has experienced COVID-19 hardship, or is recieving unemployment benefits, for a period of 60 days beginning on June 20. The Governor's order also provides that landlords are prohibited from charging late fees from March 20, 2020, through August 20, 2020 and allows tenants to put their security deposits toward rent. The legislature has also enacted a measure that requires mortgage providers to offer mortgage forebearance for up to 180 days to mortgage holders, to refrain from charging late fees, and to not report late payments to credit reporting agencies.

The Chief Administrative Judge had initially issued a one-week moratorium in New York City on 3/13/20. There will be no evictions of any kind, for anyone, as long as the 3/15/20 moratorium is in place. In NYC, all city marshals have been notified that they cannot execute any pre-existing warrants. Outside of NYC, law enforcement entities should have been notified by the local courts. 

The Governor's 3/20/20 Executive Order declared an eviction and foreclosure morotorium for 90 days. On 5/7/20, the Governor issued an Executive Order that allows tenants to use their security deposit to pay past rent, prohibits late fees, prohibits eviction for nonpayment due to COVID-19 hardship for a period of 60 days beginning on June 20, and suspends sections of the Real Property Law to provide that no landlord, lessor, sub-lessor or grantor shall demand or be entitled to any payment, fee or charge for late payment of rent occurring during the time period from March 20, 2020, through August 20, 2020.

The court also issued guidance (as opposed to an order) to local courts that suggested courts could temporarily continue eviction filings, pending eviction proceedings, scheduled move-outs, and the execution of foreclosure judgements (except in the instances where allegations of domestic violence are involved). However, the determination of how to restrict access to the court is left to local jurisdictions. Several municipal courts have ordered the suspension of evictions. Both the governor and the Supreme Court recently issued orders tolling court deadlines; in its guidance as to how this applies to evictions, the Supreme Court states, ""Nothing in the legislation or the Supreme Court’s order prevents the filing of an eviction action during the emergency period.""

,VIRGINIA (VA) CURRENT SUMMARY,Eviction Cases can Resume (Remote or In-Person),"The Governor's eviction moratorium expired on 6/28 with the passage of a $50 million rent and foreclosure relief program (RMRP). Evictions are resuming both in person and remotely (at the discretion of the court). Now that the CARES Act has expired, the earliest an unlawful detainer may be filed against a tenant living in a dwelling covered by the CARES Act is August 26, 2020—this would allow for the tenant to be on notice 30 days after the landlord to have provided notice. Under emergency House Bill 340, tenants who are defendants in unlawful detainer proceedings for the nonpayment of rent who have been affected by the pandemic, may seek a 60 day continuance if their court date for an eviction is scheduled for September 10, 2020 or earlier. In order for the court to grant the continuance, an individual must show up to the initial court date and  bring written proof that income was lost between March 10 and June 10.

The order also forbids assessing late fees or raising rent during this period. It further requires landlords to offer reasonable repayment plans when non-payment was a result of Covid-19 related hardship. Cases in which the landlord/owner can show that eviction is necessary for health or safety or where the landlord seeks to sell or personally occupy the property are excepted.

Scenario B: if the event triggering the deadline occurred during the tolling period, then the countdown for that deadline will not start running until the day the tolling period ends (e.g., if an order issued on 3/28 had a deadline of 30 days, then those 30 days would not start running until 6/19).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
